I adjusted the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. 

I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database and used flask web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

In this module, I automated the web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars.

I stored it in a NoSQL database, and then rendered the data in a web application created with Flask. 

I learned more about HTML elements, as well as class and id attributes, to identify content for web scraping.
