I adjusted the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. 

I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database and used flask web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
